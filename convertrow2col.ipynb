With the development of the Internet of Things, 5th generation wireless systems (5G), and other technologies, the large volume of data collected at the edge of networks provides a new way to improve the capabilities of GANs. Due to privacy, bandwidth, and legal constraints, it is not appropriate to upload all the data to the cloud or servers for processing. Therefore, this article focuses on deploying and training GANs at the edge rather than converging edge data to the central node. To address this problem, we designed a novel distributed learning architecture for GANs, called DANCE. DANCE can adaptively perform communication compression based on the available bandwidth, while supporting both data and model parallelism training of GANs. In addition, inspired by the gossip mechanism and Stackelberg game, a compatible algorithm, AC-GAN is proposed. The theoretical analysis guarantees the convergence of the model and the existence of approximate equilibrium in AC-GAN. Both simulation and prototype system experiments show that AC-GAN can achieve better training effectiveness with less communication overhead than the SOTA algorithms, i.e., FL-GAN and MD-GAN.\n",

However, the sleeping features and mobility of MLDC-WSN results in topology change that restricts the speed of neighbor node discovery. To highlight this concern, a novel routing protocol named as improved Bayesian clock synchronization-gossip routing protocol is proposed for an effective neighbor node discovery in MLDC-WSN. The proposed routing protocol reduces end-to-end delay, and clock drifts problems. Also, the proposed routing protocol improves the clock synchronization and captures the neighbor discovery nodes by identifying the next neighbor set in the next moment, due to the prediction of the distance and movement speed of neighbors. Simulation and analytical results showed that the proposed routing protocol superiorly decreases the end-to-end delay and energy consumption compared to the existing algorithms.\n",

            "abstract:Neighbor discovery (ND) is a key initial step of network configuration and prerequisite of vehicular ad hoc network (VANET). However, the convergence efficiency of ND is facing the requirements of multivehicle fast networking of VANET with frequent topology changes. This article proposes the gossip-based information dissemination and sensing information-assisted ND with multipacket reception (GSIM-ND) algorithm for VANET. The GSIM-ND algorithm leverages efficient gossip-based information dissemination in the case of multipacket reception (MPR). Besides, through the multitarget detection function of multiple sensors installed in roadside unit (RSU), RSU can sense the distribution of vehicles and help vehicles to obtain the distribution of their neighbors. Thus, the GSIM-ND algorithm leverages the dissemination of sensing information as well. The expected number of discovered neighbors within a given period is theoretically derived and used as the critical metric to evaluate the performance of the GSIM-ND algorithm. The expected bounds of the number of time slots when a given number of neighbors needs to be discovered are derived as well. The simulation results verify the correctness of theoretical derivation. It is discovered that GSIM-ND algorithm proposed in this article can always reach the short-term convergence quickly. Moreover, the GSIM-ND algorithm is more efficient and stable compared with the completely random algorithm (CRA), scan-based algorithm (SBA), and gossip-based algorithm. The convergence time of the GSIM-ND algorithm is 40%-90% lower than that of these existing algorithms for both low density and high density networks. Thus, GSIM-ND can improve the efficiency of ND algorithm.\n",

Peer-to-peer (P2P) technology is a typical distributed system model that is gaining popularity for delivering computing resources and services. Distributed systems try to increase its availability in the event of frequent component failures and functioning the system in such scenario is notoriously difficult. In order to identify component failures in the system and achieve global agreement (consensus) among failed components, this paper implemented an efficient failure detection and consensus algorithm based on fail-stop type process failures. The proposed algorithm is fault-tolerant to process failures occurring before and during the execution of the algorithm. The proposed algorithm works with the epidemic gossip protocol, which is a randomly generated paradigm of computation and communication that is both fault-tolerant and scalable. A simulation of an extreme-scale information dissemination process shows that global agreement can be achieved. A P2P simulator, PeerSim, is used in the paper to implement and test the proposed algorithm. The proposed algorithm results exhibited high scalability and at the same time detected all the process failures. The status of all the processes is maintained in a Boolean matrix.\n",

            "abstract:Vital societal and industrial autonomous components are increasingly interconnected through communication networks to complete critical tasks cooperatively. However, as the reliability and trust requirements for connected autonomous systems continue to grow, the centralized communication and decision approaches that are in use today are reaching their limits. Focusing on autonomous driving applications, this paper proposes a resilient and trustworthy framework on wireless distributed consensus networks, where the communication links are less reliable or are even in the presence of incorrect local sensor readings/decisions. To accomplish that, a novel three stages consensus mechanism is proposed based on the practical Byzantine fault tolerance (PBFT), where the veto collection and gossip stages are designed to meet the stringent and complex requirements for a vehicle's maneuvers. A plan tree synthesis is also proposed to make consensus on a series of decisions while adopting network members' decision preferences. A detailed protocol including the distributed consensus, plan tree synthesis, dynamic grouping, etc. is proposed. Simulation results show that the proposed consensus mechanism is able to be reached and propagated through the network under poor wireless communication conditions and the presence of faulty vehicles with incorrect sensor readings. The result can be extended to other autonomous systems to significantly enhance safety in critical industrial applications.\n",

The main benefit of P2P technology is the reduction of central server resources used by ensuring that computing resources, bandwidth resources, content resources, and so on, are consumed effectively by terminal computers. A distributed computing system or multi-agent system requires global consensus on some synchronization, an action, a decision or data value. The proposed method combines MPI_Comm_shrink() and MPI_Comm_agree() functions with the epidemic gossip protocol, which is a randomly generated paradigm of computation and communication that is both fault-tolerant and scalable. A simulation of an extreme-scale information dissemination process, used in this experimental research, shows that global agreement can be achieved. Event-based PeerSim simulator is used in the article to explore resource discovery mechanisms. Scholars have only presented a few thousand cases of HPC fault detection and agreement in the state-of-the-art literature, in contrast to proposed algorithm (Algorithm 1) exhibited high scalability and bandwidth even as the system size increased up to ten lakh nodes.\n",

            "abstract:Blockchain is a distributed digital ledger consisting of sequence of blocks. These blocks are groups of transactions that make up a sequence where each block contains the cryptographic hash of its prior block. To maintain huge networks, data integrity, and consistency some blockchain deployments uses a distributed communication method known as gossip protocol. In gossip protocol, every node/system relays any recent data to all its neighbors in an atomic fashion where each neighbor imitates the process until the whole system is synchronized. The number of iterations required to synchronize N hosts is O (log N) despite the failing nodes and data losses in transmission. However, the protocol is not cost effective when it comes to number of state exchanges and the transmission delay due to the redundant state information exchanges. To make gossip protocol more efficient; first, we propose a fail-proof algorithm that can be used under zero node failure scenarios; secondly, an opportunistic algorithm giving a rational, stable, and predictable correction phase and lastly a checking algorithm that obtains an iterative correction until a convergence or a synchronization across all the nodes in the system are reached. We implement these improvements and carefully analyze and demonstrate our findings.\n",

            "abstract:Directed acyclic graph (DAG) blockchain is a new paradigm of blockchain that solves the poor scalability and low throughput caused by a single-chain structure for IoT applications in blockchain. However, for DAG structured blockchains, it is difficult to determine the order of blocks. Additionally, there is also lack of secure and efficient ways to generate blocks in parallel. To address these problems, we propose an efficient DAG blockchain architecture. First, a novel heaviest chain rule based on the block weight is proposed to guide the selection of the parent and uncle block for a new block, which realize that appending is ordering. Second, a tree-based gossip protocol (TBGP) is proposed to improve consensus efficiency by reducing message redundancy. Furthermore, federated learning is used to select nodes constructing tree-based gossip network (TBGN). Finally, compared to random gossip protocol (RGP), the simulation results indicate TBGP can effectively reduce communication redundancy and improve consensus efficiency.\n",

            "abstract:The service function (SF) area has gained increasing attention in the last years due its ability to combine the advantages of cloud computing with network softwarization. By decoupling SFs from the physical equipment where they are executed, it is possible to make network services scalable and flexible. These advantages become even more evident in the forthcoming 6G networks, where the overall environment is expected to become more dynamic and cloud-based, with SFs deployed as cloud-native functions. However, in order to efficiently manage and compose services using these SFs, it is necessary to monitor the available resources of the nodes where they can be deployed, in addition to exchange information relevant to the operational status of active SFs. To this aim, we propose a lightweight monitoring architecture by using agents in charge of monitoring the status of SFs running in co-located clusters. These monitoring agents exchange their information by means of a gossip protocol, which allows increasing the reliability of the process. In this way, it is possible to keep service decisions as local as possible, limiting the interactions with centralized decision and orchestration platforms, and thus increasing network scalability and responsiveness. Performance evaluation shows the effectiveness of the proposed solution, and demonstrates that the network overhead of the distributed monitoring process is definitely affordable.\n",

            "abstract:Secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) offers privacy-preserving computation that could be critical in many health and finance applications. Specifically, two or more parties jointly compute a function on private inputs by following a protocol executed in rounds. The MPC network typically consists of direct peer-to-peer (P2P) connections among parties. However, this significantly increases the computation time as parties need to wait for messages from each other, thus making network communication a bottleneck. Most recent works tried to address the communication efficiency by focusing on optimizing the MPC protocol rather than the underlying network topologies and protocols. In this paper, we propose the MPC over Algorand Blockchain (MPC-ABC) protocol that packs messages into Algorand transactions and utilizes its fast gossip protocol to transmit them efficiently among MPC parties. Our approach, therefore, reduces the delay and complexity associated with the fully connected P2P network while assuring the integrity of broadcasted data. We implemented MPC-ABC and utilized it to outsource the SPDZ (SPDZ—pronounced “Speedz\"—is the nickname of the MPC protocol of Damgård et al. in (European Symposium on Research in Computer Security, pp 1–18, 2013)) protocol across multiple Cloud Service Providers (CSP). Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the commonly adopted approaches over the P2P TCP/IP network in terms of the average delay and network complexity.\n",
